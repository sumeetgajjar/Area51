<p class="ex3"><img src="img\icons\oilgasicon.png" alt="" align="left"/>When faced with extraordinary situations, anything can happen. With proper firefighting training and education, you will be able to make the right decisions in these emergency situations. Approximately 600 people die and over 4 000 are injured annually in South Africa as a result of fires, and these blazes cause more than R500 million in damages to properties every year. Action Training Academy’s firefighting training courses are aimed at teaching basic firefighting skills to minimise loss of life and property, by extinguishing fires in their early stages. The best method of stopping a fire is to prevent it. The actions taken to control a fire during the first few minutes will determine whether it can be contained or not. Minimise damage during fires by contacting us for expert firefighting training. Legislation requires that one in 50 people per company, or two people per building, be trained in basic firefighting. To ensure that there are more on-site fire safety experts available to reduce this statistic, Action Training Academy provides the following firefighting training:

Basic Fire Awareness Course – Every employee should be aware of how fires start, spread and are controlled. This course teaches general respect for fire and makes employees aware of fire risks in the workplace.

Basic Firefighter Course – Continued training and firefighting education is essential for new personnel and keeps veteran firefighting skills fresh. The fundamental skills covered in basic training ensure proper, safe execution of firefighting operations.
Advanced Firefighter Course – Building on the awareness and basic firefighting training, the advanced training teaches more practical knowledge and the use of hand-operated firefighting equipment.

SAQCC Fire Course – The SAQCC-Fire Course ensures that technicians servicing firefighting equipment have the appropriate qualification and experience to meet legal requirements in terms of SANS 1475, SABS and DOL.

Fire Safety Management and Risk Analysis Services – Fire risk is a 24/7 concern for all businesses. The assessment and management of fire risk it is complicated by environment, organisation and legislation. We provide on-site assessment and management that complies with all regulatory and quality standards to ensure your business is compliant.</p>

                <p><img src="img\icons\oilgasicon.png" alt="" align="left"/>First aid is basic knowledge about how to help people who are suddenly sick (illnesses) or hurt (injuries or body damage). For example, first aid is used at accidents to help an injured person until they receive medical treatment (help by doctors, nurses or ambulances). First aid is also used to help people who suddenly become sick, until help arrives or they can be taken to medical care.
                First aid is basic knowledge about how to help people who are suddenly sick (illnesses) or hurt (injuries or body damage). For example, first aid is used at accidents to help an injured person until they receive medical treatment (help by doctors, nurses or ambulances). First aid is also used to help people who suddenly become sick, until help arrives or they can be taken to medical care.It is best to have good training to give first aid. In addition to books and videos, good training includes a good teacher and the chance to practice. For example, CPR is practiced on a dummy called a mannequin, so a student can learn to push down on someone's chest in an emergency without actually doing it to a person. The teacher makes sure the first aid student is doing the skill correctly.First aid kits may be kept in cloth bags or plastic or metal boxes. They are often labeled with a symbol such as those on the upper right. Training can be given by an organization or by a professional medical person, like a doctor, a nurse, or a paramedic. Organizations that teach first aid include the International Red Cross, schools, hospitals, the military, Scout groups, and rescue groups such as fire departments.</P>

				<h2 align="center"><strong>HAND FINGURES AND INJURY</strong></h2>
<P><img src="img\icons\oilgasicon.png" alt="" align="left"/>At one time or another, everyone has had a minor injury to a finger, hand, or wrist that caused pain or swelling. Most of the time our body movements do not cause problems, but it's not surprising that symptoms develop from everyday wear and tear, overuse, or an injury.

Finger, hand, or wrist injuries most commonly occur during:

Sports or recreational activities.
Work-related tasks.
Work or projects around the home, especially if using machinery such as lawn mowers, snow blowers, or hand tools.
Accidental falls.
Fistfights.
The risk of finger, hand, or wrist injury is higher in contact sports, such as wrestling, football, or soccer, and in high-speed sports, such as biking, in-line skating, skiing, snowboarding, and skateboarding. Sports that require weight-bearing on the hands and arms, such as gymnastics, can increase the risk for injury. Sports that use hand equipment such as ski poles, hockey or lacrosse sticks, or racquets also increase the risk of injury.

In children, most finger, hand, or wrist injuries occur during sports or play or from accidental falls. Any injury occurring at the end of a long bone near a joint may injure the growth plate (physis) and needs to be evaluated.

Older adults are at higher risk for injuries and fractures because they lose muscle mass and bone strength (osteopenia) as they age. They also have more problems with vision and balance, which increases their risk of accidental injury.

Most minor injuries will heal on their own, and home treatment is usually all that is needed to relieve symptoms and promote healing.</P>

				<h2 align="center"><strong>HAZCOM HAZARD COMMUNICATION</strong></h2>
<p><img src="img\icons\oilgasicon.png" alt="" align="left"/>An effective HAZCOM program depends on the credibility of management's involvement in the program; inclusion of employees in safety and health decisions; rigorous worksite analysis to identify hazards and potential hazards, including those which could result from a change in worksite conditions or practices; stringent prevention and control measures; and thorough training. It addresses hazards whether or not they are regulated by government standards. The following references characterize and further explain HAZCOM programs.

Each employee who may be exposed to hazardous chemicals when working must be provided information and trained prior to initial assignment to work with a hazardous chemical, and whenever the hazard changes.

Chemical manufacturers and importers are required to obtain or develop an MSDS for each hazardous chemical they produce or import. Distributors are responsible for ensuring that their customers are provided a copy of these MSDSs. Employers must have an MSDS for each hazardous chemical they use.Job Hazard Analysis.

				<h2 align="center"><strong>HAZID HAZARD IDENTIFICATION</strong></h2>
<p><img src="img\icons\oilgasicon.png" alt="" align="left"/>HAZID (Hazard Identification) is a qualitative technique for the early identification of potential hazards and threats effecting people, the environment, assets or reputation. The major benefit of a HAZID study is to provide essential input to project development decisions.It is a means of identifying and describing HSE hazards and threats at the earliest practicable stage of a development or venture.The study method is a combination of identification, analysis and brainstorming by the HAZID team members. Guidewords are used in order to identify possible potential and hazardous effects as well as threats. Furthermore the team analyses the appropriate controls that should put in place in order to prevent or control each identified threat.
The analysis of HAZID will be conducted on a session basis, grouping the processes with the PFD (Process Flow Diagram) and plant layout into a series of sections where the various sources will have similar characteristics and hence consequences.Benefits of Carrying out HAZID

Identify opportunities for inherent safety
Identify Fire, explosion, toxic release scenarios and measure to prevent it.
Any special preparations required to be taken to handle these can be pre – planned.
Any specific process modifications if required can be established at an early stage.
Prepares the system & team, ready and confident to go ahead for commissioning. Avoids major surprises.
Hazards involved in operating each equipments can be enlisted at the beginning, leading to better process mapping & better control in future to getting OSHAS / ISO approvals.</P>

				<h2 align="center"><strong>SAFETY LEADERSHIP</strong></h2>
            <p><img src="img\icons\oilgasicon.png" alt="" align="left"/>Safety  performance is driven by the leadership of the organization. Leaders establish values, develop procedures, and enforce accountability for their safety programs. Put another way, safety leaders set the standards of safe behavior within their companies. We would obviously expect a safety leader to be someone who exhibits high SafetyDNA, but leadership is more than just managing one’s own safety behaviors. A true safety leader also motivates his or her coworkers to strive for minimal risk exposure. First, I will discuss exactly what we mean by safety leadership and the actions performed by the employees who fill this role.Safety leadership is defined as the process of interaction between leaders and followers, through which leaders can exert their influence on followers to achieve organizational safety goals. The feature of this definition that most often confuses people is the concept of leaders and followers. Too often, the terms ‘leadership’ and ‘management’ are used interchangeably. The problem here is that many do not recognize the critical differences between these roles and the vital functions of each in building strong safety performance. Specifically, managers exist as part of the organization’s structural hierarchy and exert formal influence over their subordinates, while leadership is a voluntary activity by which an individual exerts social influence over coworkers by setting an example of appropriate behavior to elicit shared goals and effect positive change in the organization. Certainly one individual can be both a manager and a leader, but this only occurs through conscious effort to effectively perform both roles.

The misconception that safety leadership refers only to those in top management is far-reaching. For example OSHA developed the 5-STARS model of safety leadership which entails:

Supervision: overseeing work activities to make sure employees are safe

Training: conducting safety education and training

Accountability: insisting that everyone complies with company safety policies and rules

Resources: providing physical resources – tools, equipment, materials – so employees can work safely</P>
